# HPI-Password-Generator
This is the GitHub repository in which CDsNTs, a group composed by Danilo Hernández, Raúl Enrique, Muhammad Ruano, Bhomik Sharma and Marco Rodríguez, developed a password generator on python for
the Technical Project assignment. This password generator generates a number of passwords based on the user's input, and then it rates their strenght by checking a set of conditions each password should have.
